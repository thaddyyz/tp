## Introduction

Large Order Tracking System (LOTS) is a Command Line (CLI) program that enables users to keep track of multiple food 
orders from a pre-set list of food items from different stores. The program helps users to collate the orders and 
displays a summary of all the orders along with other information such as an individual person’s order and the 
corresponding cost, total cost of all the orders and more. As LOTS is a CLI program, this would 
greatly benefit any user that excels in typing.

Target users includes:
1. Dinners
2. Order collators (Middleman)

3. Navigate to the folder where `LOTS` is located using terminal.
4. Start the `LOTS` program by executing `java -jar CS2113TP.jar` in the terminal.
5. You can start using the `LOTS` program by inputting commands into the command line. The list of commands and

### Adding orders: `add`

Adds a specific order for a particular person.

**Format:** `add /n [PERSON_NAME] /i [FOOD_INDEX] /q [QUANTITY]`

**Example:** `add /n Jeremy /i 2 /q 23`

* `[PERSON_NAME]` refers to the person's name who ordered this set of food.

  * `[QUANTITY]` only accepts **integers**.
  * Range of `[QUANTITY]` is from **1 to 999**.

**Note:**
1. `[PERSON_NAME]` is **individualised**. 
   * You can only use **1 name** as a reference to **1 person**.
   * Any additional `add` command with the same name will be tagged under the same person's order.
2. Adding the same order to a person with different quantity will result to **increment of the original quantity** of the order.

### Finding person: `find`

Find persons with names that contain a given string and print out their orders.

**Format:** `find /n [SEARCH_STRING]`

- `SEARCH_STRING` specifies the sub-string that you wish to search.
  - `SEARCH_STRING` must contain **at least 1** `alphanumeric` character. E.g) `a`,`1`.
- The search is **case-insensitive**. Meaning that `ABcd = abcd = ABCD`.
- The `SEARCH_STRING` does not need to contain the exact name you wish to match.
**Any** sub-string of the name will be considered a match.
    - E.g) `find /n drew` will return the name `andrew` as a match.
    
**Example of usage**
- Assume our current list contains 3 people named `TOM`, `KIM` & `KIMMY` as seen below.
- The command `find /n kim` will return both `KIM` & `KIMMY` as both names contain the string `"KIM"`.

### List current orders: `list`

Shows a list of all the orders that have been made.

**Format:** `list`

**Note:**
- Input **must not** contain any extra characters before or after `list`.

**Example of usage**
- Assume that the current stored order contains orders made by `Jerry`, `Lewis` & `Smith`.
- The `list` command will display everyone's orders, and a summary of the total number of people who have ordered and
the total quantity of food ordered.

**Example of usage**

![Bye Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/master/docs/UG%20Images/ByeExample.JPG)

### Storing data

- Data such as user orders are saved automatically after every command.
- The data are stored in a text file called `.orders.txt` located in the same directory as the main JAR file.
- If the `.orders.txt` file is not found upon initial startup, LOTS will automatically create a new empty `.orders.txt` file.
- As such, there is no need for users to manually save the data while using LOTS.  

> :exclamation: **Caution**: Users should not edit the `.orders.txt` file as it may corrupt the data stored.
