### Architecture
The Sequence Diagram below represents the interactions between components when user inputs command `add /n tom /i 1 /q 2`

The Sequence Diagram below represents the interactions between components when user inputs command `delete 1/2`

`Find`command goes through similar sequence as compared to the `delete` command sequence diagram.
The main differences are:
1. deleteOrder() is replaced with checkIfMatchAndPrint().
2. deleteParticularOrder() is replaced with getPersonName().

`Edit`command goes through similar sequence as compared to the `delete` command sequence diagram.
The main differences are:
1. deleteOrder() is replaced with editOrder().
2. editParticularOrder() is called directly from the EditCommand class instead of through a method in Person class.



#### Alternate implementation

The EditCommand function can be integrated with the deleteCommand class.
```

```

The upside of doing would be that there is less code overall.
However, doing so would result in multiple functions being in the same class which would:
1. Make the code messier.
2. Make the code more vulnerable to functionality bugs.
3. Make the code more complex to debug.
4. Make testing process more complicated.

### Edit Command
The purpose of the edit is allow the user to edit his order quantity.
The class diagram below is a brief overview of how the EditCommand class is related to other classes.

Below is a step by step example on how the parser is used when a user keys in an input.
Assuming the input is not going to be **null** or **blank**,

Step 1)<br>
Lets assume the input passed in is `delete 1/2`. The method `getCommand()` would then split the user's
input into an array of strings along the spaces and store them in the array `listOfInputs`. After which,
it will get the user's command from the 0th array element and store it in another variable called `commandInString`.
